In this repo you will find my website, with portoflio and stuff like about me, contact ect. I want to finish this site with end of march, so in first april days it will have more content and two pages in portfolio. First one will be cooking blog, and second one will be shop with flowers.</br> To create this website I'm using mainly React with basic CSS for now. </p>
